What is a lambda function in Python, and how does it differ from a regular function?\n","\n","**Answer:-**\n","1.   A **lambda function** in Python is a small anonymous function that can be defined using the lambda keyword.\n","It is called \"anonymous\" because it does not require a function name. Lambda functions are commonly\n","used when a simple function is needed for a short duration or when a function is required as an argument\n","to another function.\n","\n","2.
