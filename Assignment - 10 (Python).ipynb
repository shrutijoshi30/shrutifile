What is the role of try and exception block?\n","\n","**Answer:-**  \n","1.  The **try-except** block is used to handle exceptions or errors that may occur during the execution of a program.\n","\n","\n","2.

What happens if an exception occurs inside a try block and there is no matching except block?\n","\n","**Answer:-**\n","1.  If an exception occurs inside a try block and there is no matching except block to handle that specific exception type, the exception will propagate up the call stack.\n","\n","2.  This means that the program will terminate, and the default exception handling mechanism of the programming language will come into play. Typically, this results in an error message being displayed, and the program execution is halted.\n","\n","3.  When an exception is not caught and handled by an except block, it is considered an unhandled exception. The default behavior of most programming languages is to print an error message, including the type of the exception, a description of the error, and the traceback information.\n","\n","4.  The traceback shows the sequence of function calls that led to the point where the exception occurred, allowing developers to trace the error back to its origin.\n","\n","5.  Unhandled exceptions can cause the program to crash abruptly and may lead to unexpected behavior. They can also make it challenging to identify and fix issues in the code.\n","\n","6.   It is generally recommended to handle exceptions appropriately by providing matching except blocks to catch and handle specific exception types.\n","\n","7.  This allows for controlled error handling and the ability to provide customized error messages or recovery mechanisms based on the specific exception type."],"metadata":{"id":"9HySzLgeRtxK"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q5.
