Underscores can be used in the module name if it improves readability. Python packages should also have short, all-lowercase names, although the use of underscores is discouraged.\n","\n","4. ***Scope of the variable*** : Variable names should reflect the scope and context in which they are used. For example, using prefixes like self. for instance variables in classes, or g_ for global variables.\n","\n","5. **Use proper capitalization for constants** : If a variable is intended to be a constant (a value that does not change), it is conventionally written in uppercase letters with underscores separating words. For example, ADD_NUM, GW.\n","\n","6. ***Be written in English*** :- A general coding practice is to write code with variable names in English, as that is the most likely common language between programmers. Thus, variable names such as muuttuja (which is also not a good name on other levels) should be avoided.\n","\n","7. ***Do not use keywords*** :- Not conflict with any Python keywords, such as for, True, False, and, if, or else.

The backslash is used to escape characters that would otherwise have a special meaning within a string literal.

This is useful when working with regular expressions or file paths that contain many backslashes.\n","\n","\n","4.
